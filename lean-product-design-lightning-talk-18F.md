## Lean Product Design Lightning Talk##
**By Nick Brethauer**

I’d like to give you a really quick overview of Lean Product Design: which everyone on a product team should care about, because it’s a whole team approach to building things. I’ll give you a couple key principles that define it, and then give a quick idea about how you might start to enact them with your team within Agile.

So, what is Lean Product Design?  It grew out of lean startup ideas, and is a set of principles and techniques for iteratively building a product under conditions of uncertainty and risk, which of course are present in almost every project we take on.

**Principle 1: Value outcomes over output**

Lean Product Design at it’s heart is about valuing outcomes over output. And by that I mean, what good is shipping a feature or product if it doesn’t achieve the goal we’re trying to get to?

**Principle 2: Frame work as experiments**

The second principle  is that we should frame our work as experiments. This is important because it encourages us to take a position of humility, which means we acknowledge that what we hold true about a solution, or about our users, are usually unproven assumptions -- and what we’re building isn’t cast in stone.

**Principle 3: Holistic product strategy**

Lean Product Design is very much a holistic product strategy. The idea is that we don’t isolate the product team from the voices in the organization that aren’t typically part of the product conversation, but that when included inform key pieces of the strategy - For example “how will we reach our users”? (marketing, comms).

**Principle 4: Radical team transparency**

The fourth principle is radical transparency.  We need to do whatever we can to facilitate a shared understanding between all the members of the team, which means doing things to make sure assumptions are made explicit, that everyone is aligned on the goals we’re trying to achieve, and everyone is involved in design activities.


So how might you start to use these principles, in an Agile context?
-------------------------------------------------------

Agile is a framework for planning and working in short cycles. So Agile provides the “how” to work, but it is agnostic about what you do. This is where Lean Product Design comes in - because it provides the “why” we are doing any given thing, on a sprint to sprint basis. So when sprint planning, you can say- given the business and user goals we want to achieve, what can we do or build in these two weeks, that we can test and measure to know whether we are making progress toward that goal? 

Specifically, you can actually write your high level or medium level stories as hypotheses: We believe that doing this thing for this user, will have this effect and help us achieve this business goal, and this is our metric for knowing we’re right.

There are lots of ways these principles can be carried out with your team, but if you want to learn more about working this way:
